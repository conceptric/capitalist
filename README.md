# Capitalist

This is a simple Rails 3 based tool to help manage a personal stock portfolio. 

## Capital gains

Tracking capital gains is the first feature planned.

It's possible to have multiple positions open in an individual asset at any one time: simultaneous holdings in different accounts for example. Each of these positions can comprise multiple buying and selling transactions. 

A position is going to have an averaged buying price which is the aggregate of all the buying transactions to date, and forms the basis of any capital gains when selling all, or a proportion of the position holdings as follows:

the basic price gain = transaction selling price - averaged buying price
